Chest X-Ray Classification with Transfer Learning

Project Image

Overview

This repository contains code for classifying chest X-rays using transfer learning. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models to improve the performance of a model on a specific task, even when limited labeled data is available.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) from keggle. It consists of 500+ chest X-ray images labeled with 5  different classes.

Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on pre-trained model architecture, a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used in medical image classification tasks. The top layers of the pre-trained model were removed, and new fully connected layers were added to adapt the model to the specific chest X-ray classification task.
